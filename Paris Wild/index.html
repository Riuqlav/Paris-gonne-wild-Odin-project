                <p>So you want to see the overabundance of overpriced tourist traps and tourists flocking to all these
                    traps, some old
                    buildings, bags that don't cover the bread and a tower, you have chosen the right place!



                </p>

                                    simply
                                    referred to as "flying rats" but they are currently better qualified as "flying

                                <p>The City Rat, also known as a "Snitch" is a creature very common in Paris,
                                    It gives
                                    up incriminating evidence to people they have no business talking to in the first
                                    place. Some snitch because they need attention, others snitch because they are
                                    scared.

                                    cigarette-smelling people and croissant, is the symbiotic relationship between the
                                    inbred freak of nature, and its owner that won't pick its droppings.

                <p>
                    Maybe you are convinced to visit and appreciate the wildlife in Paris. <br>
                    Doing so is rather easy, all you need
                    is to do something dumb or accidentally mess something up, and keep trying to act innocent or claim
                    intent
                    to get positive attention instead of criticism. <br>
                <p>
                    e.g. Have messed up hair, and unmatching socks is a chance to claim to be a fashion style, low
                    effort, instead
                    of
                    admitting you just woke up 5 min ago and those were the only socks you found.</p>

                <p> <br> With this simple disguise, you'll be able to observe the animals and all the urine smell, metro
                    pickpockets, and unfriendly borderline hostile creature of Paris, book now your trip!
